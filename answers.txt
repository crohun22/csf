For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified

Sample 6 - GC-content: 0.491518518519

Problem 3:

When you comment out "seq" and "linenum" I get an error because it says that there is an error as the program tries to call something undefined

And the same happens when you comment out "gc_count"

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852

Collaboration:

I did this homework without anyone's help

Reflection:
