<h1>Homework 1: Welcome to Python</h1>

<p>
<b>Due: Thursday, 10/3, 11:59pm</b>
via GitHub. Come to lab on Thursday to learn how to submit your assignments
using GitHub.
</p>

<p>
This assignment will familiarize you with the Python programming language.
Python is an easy-to-use but powerful programming language that is
particularly well-suited to quickly creating small programs.
</p>

<p>
Python, and this class, can be done either using a command-line shell
and a text editor, or using graphical environments. Instructions for
both will be provided below. Although the command-line interface is
harder to learn, it will give experts greater power, flexibility, and
speed in performing programming tasks in the future.
</p>

<h1 id="part-i">Part I:  Get started with Python</h1>

<p>
If you need to install Python on your own machine or figure out how to use it on campus,
see <a href="http://ada.evergreen.edu/csf/python13f/python.html">Using and Installing Python</a>.
</p>

<p>
Read (and follow along with!)
<a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Edyoo/python/idle_intro/">a short tutorial for IDLE</a>.
</p>

<p>
Read from the course text <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-0">ICPUP</a> all of Chapter 1, Section 2.1, and Section 4.5, in addition to the assigned
reading from Monday of <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf">Think Python</a>, Chapters 1 and 2.
</p>
<!-- <p>
Optionally, follow the first parts of
<a href="http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/">a Python tutorial</a>.
</p>
-->

<!-- I'm not thrilled with this other tutorial: http://www.learnpython.org/ -->

<!--
Don't advertise this Python tutorial, which is for Python 3:
http://centurion2.com/Python/PythonIntro.html
(Ignore the "Installation" parts, which do not use the
Enthought Python Distribution.)
-->

<p>
There is nothing to turn in for Part I of the assignment.
</p>



<h1 id="part-ii">Part II:  Programming exercises</h1>

<p>
Download the files <a href="http://ada.evergreen.edu/csf/python13f/hw1.py"><tt>hw1.py</tt></a>
and <a href="http://ada.evergreen.edu/csf/python13f/hw1_test.py"><tt>hw1_test.py</tt></a>.
</p>

<p>
For problems in this homework, you will edit your local copy of the
<tt>hw1.py</tt> file.
You may do your work by editing and running <tt>hw1.py</tt> (we recommend
this approach), or by typing code at the Python interpreter (or in an
IDLE window) and copying it into
the appropriate part of <tt>hw1.py</tt> when you are satisfied with it.
When you have completed this homework, running the <tt>hw1.py</tt> file
should compute and print the answers to all the problems.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to include documentation (source code comments, on a line
starting with <tt>#</tt>) as appropriate in file <tt>hw1.py</tt>.
</p>


<h2>Problem 1: Roots</h2>

<!--
<p>
Compute the larger root of the quadratic equation
13 x<sup>2</sup>+78x-5083.
</p>
-->

<p>
Compute and print both roots of the quadratic equation
x<sup>2</sup>-5.86 x+ 8.5408.
</p>

<p>
Hint: recall that the roots of a quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c are x=
</p>
<table style="font-family:verdana;">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>−b ± 
    √<span style="text-decoration:overline"> 
    b<span style="font-size: 10px;vertical-align:+25%;">2</span> − 
    4ac&nbsp;</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;">
    <span style="text-decoration:overline;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    2a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Hint: use the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/math.html#math.sqrt"><tt>math.sqrt</tt></a>
function to compute the square root.  (If you are using the Python
interpreter, you need to first do <tt>import math</tt>.  This already
appears in the <tt>hw1.py</tt> file that you will be editing, so everything
is already set up for you if you are working within that file.)
Also, use the built-in <code>str</code> function to convert numbers to strings
for printing.
</p>

<h2>Problem 2: Importing</h2>

<p>
Write code that imports a module called <code>hw1-test</code> and
prints out variables within that scope named
<code>a</code>,
<code>b</code>,
<code>c</code>,
<code>d</code>,
<code>e</code>,
and <code>f</code>, as strings, one per line.
</p>

<p>

<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/math.html#math.sqrt"><tt>math.sqrt</tt></a>
</p>

<h2>Problem 3: Evaluating Boolean Expressions</h2>

<p>
Write a program that prints out the following boolean
expression (as a string) using the variables above from <code>hw1-test</code>.
</p>

<blockquote><code>
((a and b) or (not c) and not (d or e or f))
</code></blockquote>

<h2>Optional Bonus Problem 4: Comparing Outputs</h2>

<p>
If you already have programming experience, either in another
language or in Python, then attempt this additional bonus
problem. Bonus problems will appear positively in your
course evaluation.
</p>

<p>
Write a Python program, possibly combined with a bash shell
script, that grades the outputs of the previous three programs.
One suggestion is to write a text file with the correct outputs,
and use the unix <code>diff</code> and <code>wc</code> commands
to compare a program's actual output with the produced output.
You can use the <code>hw1_test.py</code> as is.
</p>

<h2>Optional Bonus Problem 5: Creating a Test Harness</h2>

<p>
This is the same problem as the one above, but you should
modify your solution to test all possible combinations
of the six boolean variables in Problem 3, by modifying
their value in the module <code>hw1_test</code>, just
as you saw me modify the value of <code>pi</code> in class,
and then verifying the output of <code>hw1.py</code>
</p>

<h2>Collaborators</h2>

<p>
Be sure to list your collaborators, or any websites or
other sources of information that you used.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
In the comments of your submitted source file, write how long
this assignment took you, including doing readings and
tutorials. Did the readings, tutorials, and lecture
contain everything you needed to know to solve this problem?
</p>

<h2>Submitting your homework</h2>

<p>
If you already know how to use github, add it to a repository
called <code>csf</code> shared with the instructor (username
<code>ppham</code>, as we all did in Lecture 1), commit it,
and push it.
</p>

<p>
If you don't know how to use github, don't worry!
We'll do it in lab on Thursday.
</p>
