The original Idea for our project is to have python draw some predertimined notes on a pre-drawn scale
and then after having drawn the notes will go back through and play said notes (for length and possibly pitch)
This ideally will lead to user interface with note placement, length and tone.

I am planning to complete this project with Zach Adam (adazac10)
